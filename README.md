# Jupyter for image processing

Just simple tests of image processing using Jupyter in VS Code.

To use, start up virtual env and activate:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

Now, install reqs:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here is a 2GB image dataset from Milvus that I used to test with <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n_370-5Stk4t0uDV1QqvYkcvyV8rbw0O/view?usp=sharing>.
